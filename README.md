Welcome to the Ikea Skadis Adapters project! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of adaptors and joinery solutions that bridge two great standards: Ikea Skadis pegboards and 2020 aluminium extrusion systems.

## Overview

This project creates a unified ecosystem between these two popular standards, allowing you to:

- Connect Ikea Skadis pegboards to 2020 aluminium extrusion frameworks
- Expand your Skadis pegboards using specialized joinery components

- Create custom workspaces and organization solutions

Each model is designed with precision to ensure seamless integration between these two widely-used systems.
