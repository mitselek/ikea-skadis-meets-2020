## 🎯 **HOW THE AI SYSTEM WORKS**

### **Step 1: Intelligent Analysis**

When you click "Send Template Message", the AI:

1. **Analyzes the prospect's comment** for technical keywords, problems, interests
2. **Determines technical level** (high/medium/low) based on language used
3. **Identifies problem areas** (stability issues, organization needs, etc.)
4. **Maps interests** (workshop setup, DIY projects, mounting solutions)

### **Step 2: Smart Template Selection**

The AI chooses the optimal template:

- **Technical users** → Technical Focus template with detailed specs
- **Problem mentions** → Problem-Solution template addressing specific issues
- **Detailed commenters** → Community template for relationship building
- **Brief commenters** → Brief & Direct template for quick engagement

### **Step 3: Dynamic Personalization**

Each message includes personalized elements:

- **Technical details** adapted to user's level
- **Problem-specific solutions** addressing their exact needs
- **Project references** mentioning their specific interests
- **Call-to-action** matching their engagement style

### **Step 4: Performance Tracking**

The system tracks:

- **AI confidence scores** for each message generated
- **Personalization effectiveness** (number of custom elements used)
- **Template performance** (which approaches work best)
- **Campaign optimization** insights and recommendations

### **For Technical User:**

Hi [Username],

I came across your detailed technical comment on [Project] and noticed you're quite 
technical with SKÅDIS systems. As a fellow maker working with precision engineering, 
I thought you might find my latest hook design interesting.

🔧 Two-slot mounting system (40mm spacing) for superior stability
🔧 Four variants: U, U-o, H, H-o hooks for different applications
🔧 Precision tolerances optimized for standard FDM printers
🔧 Material tested with PLA, PETG, and ABS filaments

The project includes complete documentation with assembly photos and print settings:

Would love to get your technical feedback on the design!

Best,
Mihkel

### **For Problem-Focused User:**

```text
Hi [Username],

Saw your comment on [Project] - I can relate to those stability challenges!

I've been frustrated with similar issues and designed a solution that might interest you. 
My two-slot mounting system completely eliminates the wobble and rotation issues you 
get with single-slot hooks.

• Two-slot mounting system eliminates hook wobble and rotation
• 40mm standard spacing ensures perfect alignment with SKÅDIS boards
• Superior stability compared to single-slot designs

Here's the project if you'd like to check it out:

Curious if you've had similar stability issues with standard hooks?

Cheers,
Mihkel
