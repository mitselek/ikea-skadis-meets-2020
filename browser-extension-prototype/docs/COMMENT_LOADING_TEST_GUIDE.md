# Manual Testing Guide for the Comment Auto-Loading Fix

## Overview
This guide helps you manually test the fix for the "Error auto-loading comments" issue in the SKÅDIS Outreach Helper browser extension prototype.

## Prerequisites
1. A Chrome browser with developer mode enabled
2. The SKÅDIS Outreach Helper extension loaded as an unpacked extension
3. Access to MakerWorld pages with comments

## Testing Steps

### 1. Prepare the Environment
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `/browser-extension-prototype` folder
4. Ensure the extension is enabled (toggle should be on)

### 2. Basic Functionality Test
1. Navigate to a MakerWorld page with comments (e.g., a popular model page)
2. Click on the SKÅDIS extension icon to open the popup
3. Click the "Auto-load all comments" button
4. Watch for the status messages - it should indicate progress and eventually show success
5. Verify that the "Extract comments" button works after comments are loaded

### 3. Error Handling Test
1. Navigate to a non-MakerWorld page
2. Try to click "Auto-load all comments" - it should show an error message about being on the wrong page
3. Navigate to a MakerWorld page with very few or no comments
4. Try the auto-load function - it should either find the comments or provide a clear message that none were found

### 4. Edge Cases Test
1. Test on a MakerWorld page with many comments (100+) to ensure it can handle large comment sections
2. Test on a slow connection (you can use Chrome DevTools to simulate this)
3. Test on pages with different UI layouts on MakerWorld

### 5. Console Debugging
1. Open Chrome DevTools console (F12 > Console tab)
2. Navigate to a MakerWorld page
3. Click the extension icon and use the auto-load comments feature
4. Watch for any errors or warnings in the console - there should be none
5. Review the log messages to ensure the process is working as expected

## What to Look For
- No "Error auto-loading comments" messages
- Clear feedback on progress and completion
- Proper detection and loading of comments
- No browser freezing or excessive CPU usage
- Correct extraction of comments after auto-loading completes

## Test Results Recording
Document your testing results in a simple format:

```
Page URL: (The MakerWorld URL you tested)
Comments Found: (Number of comments loaded)
Time to Complete: (Approximate seconds)
Success/Failure: (Did it work correctly?)
Any Errors: (Note any errors observed)
Notes: (Any additional observations)
```

Submit your test results to help validate the fix across different scenarios.
