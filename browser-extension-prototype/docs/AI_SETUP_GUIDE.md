# 🤖 Real AI Assistant Setup Guide

The SKÅDIS Outreach Helper now includes a **Real AI Assistant** that can synthesize truly personalized messages by analyzing the original user's comments and creating natural, maker-to-maker conversations instead of template-based messages.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Get an AI API Key

Choose one of these providers:

#### Option A: OpenAI (GPT-4)

1. Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

#### Option B: Anthropic (Claude)

1. Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in  
3. Generate an API key
4. Copy the key

### Step 2: Configure in Extension

1. Click the **🤖 Configure AI Assistant** button in the extension
2. Select your AI provider (OpenAI or Anthropic)
3. Paste your API key
4. Click **🔍 Test Connection** to verify it works
5. Click **💾 Save Config** to save

### Step 3: Test Real AI Messages

1. Extract some prospects with **💬 Extract Comments**
2. Click **📧 Send Template Message**
3. Look for console logs showing "✨ Real AI synthesized personalized message"

## 🎯 How It Works

### Template System (Fallback)

- Uses predefined templates with placeholders
- Good quality but generic feeling
- Always works offline

### Real AI Synthesis

- Analyzes the user's original comment
- Takes your template as inspiration
- Creates natural, personalized conversations
- Feels like real maker-to-maker communication

## 📊 Message Quality Comparison

### Template Message Example

Hi JohnMaker,

Saw your comment on this SKÅDIS project - great to meet another SKÅDIS enthusiast!

I've been working on some enhanced SKÅDIS hooks that solve the stability issues...

### Real AI Synthesized Example

```text
Hi JohnMaker,

I noticed your comment about the wobbling issues with single-slot hooks - I've had the exact same frustration! 

I ended up designing a two-slot mounting system that completely eliminates that problem. Since you mentioned working on tool organization, I think you'd really appreciate how much more stable these are...
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Privacy & Security

- API keys are stored locally in your browser
- Messages are sent only to your chosen AI provider
- No data is shared with the extension developer

### Cost Management

- OpenAI GPT-4: ~$0.03-0.06 per message
- Anthropic Claude: ~$0.015-0.075 per message
- Both providers offer free credits for new users

### Fallback Behavior

- If Real AI fails or isn't configured, the system automatically falls back to template messages
- No interruption to your workflow

## 🎛️ Advanced Usage

### Disable Real AI

- Click **❌ Disable Real AI** to return to template-only mode
- Useful for cost management or offline use

### Monitor Usage

- Check browser console for AI generation logs
- Template tracking shows "Real AI: Synthesized" vs "AI: [Template Name]"

### Multiple Providers

- Switch between OpenAI and Anthropic anytime
- Test both to see which style you prefer

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Connection Failed" Error

- Check your API key is correct
- Verify you have credits/quota remaining
- Ensure internet connection is stable

### "Falls Back to Templates"

- Real AI is working as designed - template fallback is normal
- Check console logs for specific error messages
- Verify API key is still valid

### Cost Concerns

- Start with small batches to test
- Monitor your API usage on provider dashboards
- Disable Real AI if costs exceed budget

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Always test connection before bulk messaging
2. **Monitor Costs**: Check API usage regularly
3. **Review Messages**: Real AI messages are typically higher quality, but always review before sending
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Use Real AI for high-value prospects, templates for bulk outreach

## 🎯 **SYSTEM PROMPT CONFIGURATION**

The extension includes **System Prompts** - customizable guidelines that ensure consistent, high-quality messaging across all templates.

### What System Prompts Do

- **Consistent messaging guidelines** across all templates
- **Enhanced AI context** for better personalization  
- **Quality standards** for professional communication
- **Customizable instructions** that adapt to your style

### How It Works

**🤖 AI System Prompts**: Provide comprehensive context to AI for message generation  
**📝 Standard Template Prompts**: Guide template-based message generation when AI unavailable

### Current Default System Prompt (AI)

```text
You are a friendly and professional maker reaching out to fellow 3D printing enthusiasts about your SKÅDIS hook project. Be genuine, helpful, and focus on the technical benefits that solve real workshop organization problems. Keep messages conversational but informative, and always end with a call-to-action that invites feedback or questions.

Key principles:
- Personalize based on their specific comment or project
- Highlight technical innovations (two-slot mounting, stability improvements) 
- Mention practical benefits (cable management, precision tool mounting)
- Include complete project documentation as a value-add
- Sound like a peer, not a salesperson
- Keep it under 150 words unless they showed high technical engagement
```

### Usage

**Through Browser Console:**

```javascript
// Check current system prompts
getSystemPrompts()

// Update system prompts
updateSystemPrompts(
  "Your custom AI prompt here...", 
  "Your custom standard guidance here..."
)

// Toggle system prompts
toggleSystemPrompts(true)  // Enable
toggleSystemPrompts(false) // Disable

// Test functionality
testSystemPrompts()
```

### Benefits

- **🎯 Consistency**: All messages follow the same quality standards
- **🚀 Enhanced AI Performance**: AI receives clear instructions for better personalization
- **📈 Better Results**: Higher response rates from more targeted messaging
- **🔧 Flexibility**: Easily customize prompts for different campaigns

### Best Practices for System Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Include clear guidelines about tone, length, and content
2. **Include Context**: Provide background about your project and goals
3. **Set Boundaries**: Specify what to include/exclude in messages
4. **Define Success**: Explain what makes a good message for your campaign
