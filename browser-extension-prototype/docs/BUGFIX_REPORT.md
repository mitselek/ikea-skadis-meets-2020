# Bug Fix Report: "Error auto-loading comments"

## Issue Description
Users were experiencing an "Error auto-loading comments" message when trying to use the auto-load comments feature in the browser extension. This prevented the feature from working properly and gathering comments from MakerWorld pages.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Promise Handling Issues**: The original `autoLoadCommentsFunction` had complex and buggy promise handling that could lead to unhandled rejections and errors.
2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple nested callbacks and timeouts created race conditions that could cause unexpected behavior.
3. **CSP (Content Security Policy) Issues**: The script injection wasn't using the proper `world: "MAIN"` parameter to ensure access to page context.
4. **Error Handling Gaps**: The code had some improved error handling but still contained gaps that could lead to uncaught exceptions.
5. **Complex Selector Logic**: The code was trying too many different approaches at once without proper fallbacks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Error Handling
- Added proper try/catch blocks throughout the code
- Implemented better status feedback for users
- Added defensive programming techniques to prevent null reference errors

### 2. Fixed Script Injection
- Added `world: "MAIN"` parameter to ensure script has proper access to page context
- Added delays before script execution to ensure the page is ready
- Implemented proper promise handling for asynchronous operations

### 3. Enhanced Comment Detection
- Improved selectors for finding comment sections with better fallbacks
- Added content-based detection as a supplementary method
- Added multiple methods to detect "Load More" buttons
- Implemented safer methods to interact with page elements

### 4. Added Timeout Protection
- Added a global timeout to prevent infinite operations
- Added checks to abort scrolling after a reasonable number of attempts
- Implemented graceful completion even when errors occur

### 5. Code Architecture
- Separated concerns into discrete functions with single responsibilities
- Improved the promise structure to be more reliable
- Added a flag to properly identify extension context: `window.__skadisOutreachExtensionActive`

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to a MakerWorld page with comments
2. Click on the SKÃ…DIS Outreach Helper extension icon
3. Click the "Auto-load all comments" button
4. Verify that comments are properly loaded without errors
5. Check that the extraction process completes successfully

## Additional Notes
- The changes maintain backward compatibility with the rest of the extension
- The code is now more robust against different page structures and timing issues
- The timeout protection will prevent the extension from hanging indefinitely
