# Design Specifications for Ikea Skadis Adapters and 2020 Aluminium Extrusion Rods

## Overview

This document outlines the design specifications for the adaptors and joins created to connect Ikea Skadis pegboards with 2020 aluminium extrusion rods.

## Dimensions

- **Adaptor Length:** xmm
- **Adaptor Width:** ymm
- **Adaptor Height:** zmm
- **Join Length:** xmm
- **Join Width:** ymm
- **Join Height:** zmm

## Materials

- **Primary Material:** PLA* (Polylactic Acid), PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol), or PCTG (Preferred, Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol-modified)
- **Recommended Nozzle Size:** 0.4mm
- **Recommended Layer Height:** 0.2mm

---
> *PLA is only suitable for applications with minimal load requirements. For load-bearing applications, PETG, PCTG or stronger materials are recommended.

## Tolerances

- **Adaptor Fit Tolerance:** ±0.2mm
- **Join Fit Tolerance:** ±0.1mm

## Design Features

- **Mounting Holes:**
  - 5mm diameter holes (countersunk and flat*) for 2020 aluminum extrusion connections
  - 5mm x 15mm slots for Skadis pegboard connections (standard Skadis hole dimensions)
  - 4mm (countersunk and flat*) holes for connecting to other constructions
- **Reinforcement Ribs:** Integrated for added strength
- **Surface Finish:** Smooth finish recommended for aesthetic appeal

## *Mounting Hole Types

- **Countersunk Holes:** These have an angled recess that allows the screw head to sit flush with or below the surface of the material. Used where a smooth, flat surface is required or where the screw should not protrude above the surface.

- **Flat Holes:** These are straight cylindrical holes without a recess, designed for flat-head screws or bolts. The screw head will remain visible and slightly raised above the surface.

The choice between countersunk and flat mounting holes in these designs is based on:

1. The orientation of print layers for maximum strength
2. The specific mounting requirements of different connection points
3. The need for a flush finish in certain areas

## Assembly Instructions

1. Align the adaptor with the pegboard and extrusion rod.
2. Secure using screws through the mounting holes.
3. Ensure all connections are tight and stable.
4. **Perform your own material testing:**
   - Before final assembly, test a sample print to determine the point of material failure through controlled overtightening
   - Establish safe torque limits for your specific print and material
   - Use this knowledge to properly tighten screws during final assembly without risking component failure
