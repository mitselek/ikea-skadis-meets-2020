# Printing Guidelines for Ikea Skadis meets 2020 Adapters

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for 3D printing the adapters and joins designed for compatibility with Ikea Skadis pegboards and 2020 aluminium extrusion rods. Following these guidelines will help ensure optimal print quality and functionality of the models.

## Recommended Printing Settings

- **Layer Height**: 0.2 mm for a good balance between detail and print time.
- **Perimeters**: 4 perimeters for optimal strength.
- **Top and Bottom Layers**: 8 layers for solid surfaces.
- **Infill**: No infill necessary (0%) as strength comes from perimeters and solid layers.
- **Seam Position**: Random seams to avoid visible lines and improve structural integrity.
- **Supports**: No supports needed; models are designed to print without support material.

## Material Recommendations

- **PLA**: Easy to print and widely available; suitable for most applications with minimal load.
- **PETG**: Offers better durability and flexibility; recommended for functional parts.
- **PCTG**: Preferred material for this project; combines excellent strength, durability, and easier printing characteristics compared to regular PETG.
- **ABS**: Provides good strength and heat resistance; requires a heated bed and proper ventilation.

## Tips for Successful Printing

1. **Bed Adhesion**: Ensure proper bed adhesion to prevent warping. Use a suitable adhesive or print on a textured surface.
2. **Calibration**: Regularly calibrate your printer to maintain accuracy in dimensions.
3. **Cooling**: Use adequate cooling for PLA prints to improve surface finish and detail.
4. **Test Prints**: Consider printing single test pieces to verify settings before printing larger batches.

## Screw Selection Based on Print Orientation

The designs in this project have already taken into account optimal print orientation for strength and durability. The mounting holes have been specifically designed with the following considerations:

- **Countersunk Holes:** Positioned where the hole is perpendicular to print layers for better pressure distribution.

- **Flat Head Holes:** Used where the screw hole runs parallel to print layers to prevent layer separation.

Simply follow the recommended print orientations provided with each model file to achieve the intended strength characteristics.
