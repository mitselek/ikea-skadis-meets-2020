# IKEA SKÅDIS to 2020 Aluminum Extrusion Adapters

This document provides a detailed description of the adapters designed to connect IKEA SKÅDIS pegboards to 2020 aluminum extrusion profiles. These adapters enable users to create versatile and customizable setups that combine the popular pegboard system with the flexibility of aluminum extrusions.

## Overview

The adapters create a bridge between IKEA SKÅDIS pegboards and the versatile 2020 aluminum extrusion system, allowing for a wide range of configurations and applications. There are two main design variants available:

### Primary Design: Normal Hooks (Recommended)

The normal hooks are the main design and recommended for most applications due to their superior stability and strength:

- **Normal Horizontal Hook (11mm)**: Enables mounting pegboards on both sides of a horizontal extrusion where holes are 11mm from the extrusion
- **Normal Vertical Hook (26mm)**: Allows mounting pegboards on both sides of a vertical extrusion where holes are 26mm from the extrusion

![Vertical Hook Adapter](../../images/2020 meets skadis/2020-meet-skadis hook (V).jpg)

These adapters provide excellent stability and are perfect for:

- Creating dividers or back-to-back workstations without any additional hardware
- Permanent installations requiring maximum strength
- Any setup where both sides of the extrusion are accessible

### Alternative Design: Half Hooks

The half hooks should be considered for temporary setups or situations where access to both sides of the extrusion is limited:

These adapters are designed with specific offsets to connect a SKÅDIS pegboard to a 2020 aluminum extrusion:

- **Half Horizontal Hook (11mm)**: For connecting pegboards where holes are 11mm from the extrusion
- **Half Vertical Hook (26mm)**: For connecting pegboards where holes are 26mm from the extrusion

Half hooks are particularly useful for:

- Quick temporary setups or prototyping
- Situations where only one side of the extrusion is accessible
- Wall-mounted systems where the extrusion is against a wall
- Testing different layouts before permanent installation
- Temporary displays or organizational systems

## Features

- **Completely Hardware-Free**: Elegant design requires absolutely no screws, nuts, or tools
- **Perfect Fit**: Precisely sized variants for both horizontal (11mm) and vertical (26mm) mounting distances
- **Anti-Rattle Design**: Clips center the 5mm thick SKÅDIS board perfectly in the 6mm wide 2020 extrusion slots, preventing unwanted movement
- **Snap-In Installation**: Simply insert into pegboard holes and clip into extrusion slots
- **Durability**: Print with PCTG or other high-quality materials to ensure long-lasting use
- **Versatility**: Available in both normal and half hook variants for various configurations

## Installation Instructions

These adapters are designed for completely tool-free, hardware-free assembly:

### Simple One-Step Installation

#### For Normal Hooks (Recommended Method)

1. Position your SKÅDIS pegboards on both sides of the 2020 extrusion
2. Insert the normal adapter hooks through the holes in both pegboards
3. The adapter will clip securely into both pegboards and the extrusion slot

#### For Half Hooks (When Both Sides Aren't Accessible)

1. Insert the adapter hooks through the holes in your SKÅDIS pegboard
2. Push the other end of the adapter directly into the slot of your 2020 extrusion
3. The adapter will clip securely, but will have less stability than the normal version

The adapters are specifically sized to match the exact distance between the SKÅDIS pegboard holes and the 2020 extrusion:

- **Horizontal adapters**: 11mm spacing between pegboard hole and extrusion
- **Vertical adapters**: 26mm spacing between pegboard hole and extrusion

## Printing Guidelines

For optimal results when 3D printing these adapters:

- Use PCTG, PETG, or ABS for durability (PLA is not recommended for long-term structural use)
- Print with at least 25% infill
- 3-4 perimeters for sufficient strength
- No supports needed
- Print in the orientation shown in the model files

## Maintenance

To maintain the integrity of the adapters, periodically check for any signs of wear or damage. Clean with a damp cloth as needed to remove dust and debris.

## Load Capacity

These clip-in adapters are designed primarily for organizational purposes and lightweight storage. The following load capacities apply only when the SKÅDIS pegboard is supported solely by these adapters (without additional wall mounting or support):

### Normal Hooks (Recommended)

- **Maximum recommended load**: 2-3kg (4.4-6.6lbs) per adapter when properly installed
- Significantly greater stability due to balanced forces on both sides of the extrusion
- Recommended for permanent installations and heavier loads

### Half Hooks

- **Maximum recommended load**: 0.5-1kg (1.1-2.2lbs) per adapter when properly installed
- Less stable than normal versions; best for temporary use or lightweight items
- Consider these as "temporary" solutions when both sides aren't accessible

### General Guidelines

- For heavier loads, use multiple adapters following the SKÅDIS 4cm (40mm) grid pattern
- Ideally place adapters every 1-3 grid holes (4-12cm) depending on load requirements
- Always distribute weight evenly across multiple connection points
- The clip-in design prioritizes ease of installation and reconfigurability
- If significant load capacity is needed, consider additionally mounting the pegboard to a wall or other structure
- Load ratings are significantly increased when the pegboard is also supported by other means

## Applications

These adapters excel in various settings:

- **Workshop Organization**: Attach pegboards to existing aluminum extrusion workbenches
- **Home Office**: Create modular desk organization systems
- **Makerspaces**: Build reconfigurable tool storage walls
- **Retail Displays**: Design adaptable product showcases
- **Kitchen Organization**: Add pegboard storage to aluminum framed shelving
