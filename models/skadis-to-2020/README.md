# IKEA SKÅDIS to 2020 Aluminum Extrusion Adapters

This document provides a detailed description of the adapters designed to connect IKEA SKÅDIS pegboards to 2020 aluminum extrusion profiles. These adapters enable users to create versatile and customizable setups that combine the popular pegboard system with the flexibility of aluminum extrusions.

## Overview

The adapters create a bridge between IKEA SKÅDIS pegboards and the versatile 2020 aluminum extrusion system, allowing for a wide range of configurations and applications. These adapters connect ONE pegboard to ONE extrusion (they do NOT connect two pegboards together).

There are two main design variants available:

### Primary Design: Normal Hooks (Recommended)

The normal hooks are the main design and recommended for most applications due to their superior stability and strength. These hooks clip into the SKÅDIS pegboard on one end and grip both sides of the extrusion channel on the other end:

- **Normal Horizontal Hook (11mm)**: For mounting a pegboard where holes are 11mm from a horizontal extrusion
- **Normal Vertical Hook (26mm)**: For mounting a pegboard where holes are 26mm from a vertical extrusion

![Vertical Hook Adapter](../../images/2020_meets_skadis/2020-meet-skadis_hook_(V).jpg)

These adapters provide excellent stability and are perfect for:

- Creating sturdy pegboard mounts on extrusion frames
- Permanent installations requiring maximum strength
- Any setup where both sides of the extrusion channel can be accessed

The normal hook connects to the SKÅDIS pegboard on one end and securely clips into both sides of the 2020 extrusion channel on the other end, providing maximum stability. The positioning and connection details are shown in the Visual Installation Guide below.

### Alternative Design: Half Hooks

The half hooks should be considered for temporary setups or situations where access to both sides of the extrusion is limited. Unlike normal hooks which grip both sides of the extrusion channel, half hooks only clip into one side of the channel, providing less stability but more flexibility in certain situations:

- Quick temporary setups or prototyping
- Situations where only one side of the extrusion is accessible
- Wall-mounted systems where the extrusion is against a wall
- Testing different layouts before permanent installation
- Temporary displays or organizational systems

## Features

- **Completely Hardware-Free**: Elegant design requires absolutely no screws, nuts, or tools
- **Perfect Fit**: Precisely sized variants for both horizontal (11mm) and vertical (26mm) mounting distances
- **Anti-Rattle Design**: Clips center the 5mm thick SKÅDIS board perfectly in the 6mm wide 2020 extrusion slots, preventing unwanted movement
- **Snap-In Installation**: Simply insert into pegboard holes and clip into extrusion slots
- **Durability**: Print with PCTG or other high-quality materials to ensure long-lasting use
- **Versatility**: Available in both normal and half hook variants for various configurations

### Understanding the Diagram

The diagram above shows a top-view cross-section of how the SKÅDIS pegboard and 2020 extrusion should be positioned relative to each other:

1. **Connection Points**: The "s" markers in the diagram indicate where the pegboard should slot into the extrusion.

2. **T-Slot Structure**: The 2020 extrusion profile shows the T-slots where the adapter hooks will connect:
   - The "x" markers indicate the critical connection points inside the T-slots
   - For normal hooks: The hook clips into both sides of the T-slot (both "x" points)
   - For half hooks: The hook clips into just one side of the T-slot (one "x" point)

3. **Hook Connection**: The adapter creates a secure bridge between the pegboard hole ("O") and the extrusion's T-slot profile, with the hook part extending from the pegboard into the extrusion slot.

For optimal stability, install multiple adapter hooks following the 40mm grid pattern of the SKÅDIS pegboard holes, especially when mounting heavier items.

## Installation & Usage Guide

These adapters are designed for completely tool-free, hardware-free assembly. Here's how to install and use them effectively:

### Installation Methods

#### For Normal Hooks (Recommended Method)

⚠️ **Note**: When installing normal hooks, be careful not to apply excessive bending force as this can cause them to break at the bend. If you experience repeated breakage, consider using two half-hooks installed together instead.

##### Method 1: Pre-attach to pegboard (Recommended to prevent breakage)

1. Insert the normal adapter hooks into the holes of your SKÅDIS pegboard first
2. Carefully slide the entire pegboard with attached hooks into the 2020 extrusion slots
3. This method significantly reduces stress on the hooks during installation, minimizing the risk of breakage
4. For best results, ensure the pegboard and extrusion are perfectly parallel before sliding in

##### Method 2: Standard installation

1. Position your SKÅDIS pegboard next to the 2020 extrusion, maintaining the correct distance:
   - 11mm spacing for horizontal adapters
   - 26mm spacing for vertical adapters

2. Insert the normal adapter hook through the hole in your pegboard (the "O" shown in the diagram)

3. Push the ends into the 2020 extrusion T-slots (shown as "x" in the diagram) so it clips to both sides of the channel
   - Use even pressure across the hook to prevent breaking at the bend
   - Insert at a slight angle, then rotate into position rather than forcing straight in
   - For tight fits, slightly warming the hook can make installation easier

4. The hook will clip securely into the pegboard and grip both sides of the extrusion slot, creating a stable connection

5. For maximum stability, install multiple hooks following the 40mm SKÅDIS grid pattern, especially when mounting heavier items

#### For Half Hooks

Half hooks can be used in several effective ways:

##### Method 1: Using two half-hooks together

1. Insert two half hooks into the same pegboard hole (from opposite sides)
2. Slide both into the 2020 extrusion slot
3. This creates a configuration similar to the normal hook but with more flexibility
4. This method is recommended if you experience breakage with normal hooks, as it provides the same stability and load capacity without the installation stress

##### Method 2: Direct insertion (When Both Sides Aren't Accessible)

1. Insert the adapter hooks through the holes in your SKÅDIS pegboard
2. Push the other end into the slot of your 2020 extrusion
3. The adapter will clip securely, but has less stability than the normal version
4. For better stability, consider using two half hooks in the same pegboard hole (as described in Method 1)

## Printing Guidelines

For optimal results when 3D printing these adapters:

- Use PCTG, PETG, or ABS for durability (PLA is not recommended for long-term structural use)
- Print with at least 25% infill
- 4 perimeters recommended for optimal strength
- No supports needed
- Print in the orientation shown in the model files
- For normal hooks, ensure good layer adhesion to withstand the installation bending forces

### Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

- **Hook Won't Clip**: Check that you're using the correct hook type (horizontal vs vertical) for your setup
- **Pegboard Too Far**: Verify you're using the right hook - 11mm for horizontal, 26mm for vertical spacing
- **Feels Unstable**: Add more connection points or consider using normal hooks instead of half hooks
- **Hook Broke During Installation**:
  - This usually happens with normal hooks - use less force and more even pressure
  - Try the pre-attach to pegboard method to reduce stress during installation
  - If breakage persists, switch to using two half-hooks installed together in the same hole (from opposite sides)
  - If a hook breaks during installation, unfortunately it must be discarded

## Maintenance

To maintain the integrity of the adapters, periodically check for any signs of wear or damage. Clean with a damp cloth as needed to remove dust and debris.

## Normal vs Half Hooks: Feature Comparison

| Feature | Normal Hooks | Half Hooks | Two Half Hooks Together |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Installation Complexity** | Moderate - requires inserting with some force | Simple - easy slide-in installation | Simple - two separate easy insertions |
| **Stability** | High - grips both sides of extrusion channel | Low to moderate - grips only one side | High - grips both sides like normal hook |
| **Load Capacity** | 2-3kg (4.4-6.6lbs) per adapter | 0.5-1kg (1.1-2.2lbs) per adapter | 2-3kg (4.4-6.6lbs) per pair |
| **Ideal Use Case** | Permanent installations | Temporary setups or limited-access situations | Alternative to normal hooks when breakage is an issue |
| **Removal Ease** | More difficult to remove | Easy to remove and reposition | Moderately easy to remove |
| **Breakage Risk During Installation** | Moderate - can break at the bend point | Low - minimal stress during installation | Low - minimal stress during installation |
| **Extrusion Accessibility Needed** | Both sides accessible | Only one side accessible | Both sides accessible |
| **Recommended For** | Workshop organization, heavy tools | Quick prototyping, light items, displays | Same uses as normal hooks but when installation breaks normal hooks |

## Load Capacity

These clip-in adapters are designed primarily for organizational purposes and lightweight storage. The following load capacities apply only when the SKÅDIS pegboard is supported solely by these adapters (without additional wall mounting or support):

### Normal Hooks (Recommended)

- **Maximum recommended load**: 2-3kg (4.4-6.6lbs) per adapter when properly installed
- Significantly greater stability due to balanced forces on both sides of the extrusion
- Recommended for permanent installations and heavier loads

### Half Hooks

- **Maximum recommended load**: 0.5-1kg (1.1-2.2lbs) per adapter when properly installed
- Less stable than normal versions; best for temporary use or lightweight items
- Consider these as "temporary" solutions when both sides aren't accessible

### General Guidelines

- For heavier loads, use multiple adapters following the SKÅDIS 4cm (40mm) grid pattern
- Ideally place adapters every 1-3 grid holes (4-12cm) depending on load requirements
- Always distribute weight evenly across multiple connection points
- The clip-in design prioritizes ease of installation and reconfigurability
- If significant load capacity is needed, consider additionally mounting the pegboard to a wall or other structure
- Load ratings are significantly increased when the pegboard is also supported by other means

## Applications

These adapters excel in various settings:

- **Workshop Organization**: Attach pegboards to existing aluminum extrusion workbenches
- **Home Office**: Create modular desk organization systems
- **Makerspaces**: Build reconfigurable tool storage walls
- **Retail Displays**: Design adaptable product showcases
- **Kitchen Organization**: Add pegboard storage to aluminum framed shelving
