# 2020 Extrusion Roller Bearings

These roller bearings are designed to fit snugly around standard 2020 aluminum extrusion profiles.

## Features

- **Snug Fit:** The bearing hub is precisely dimensioned for a secure, low-play fit on 2020 extrusions.
- **Low-Friction Rollers:** Uses standard 7mm x 10mm nylon spacers as rollers for smooth, quiet operation and excellent wear resistance.
- **Easy Assembly:** Snap-fit clips and modular design allow for quick, tool-free assembly.
- **Versatile Applications:** Ideal for projects involving 2020 extrusions.

## Construction & Parts Description

- **Hub:** The central round part that fits tightly around the 2020 extrusion, providing the main support and rotational axis for the bearing.
- **Outer Shell:** The external cylindrical part that surrounds the hub. This is the rolling surface and, in the rimmed variant, includes the wider rim for supporting spools or rolls.
- **Channels:** Both the hub and the outer shell have small channels at each end. These channels are designed to accept the clips.
- **Clips:** Snap into the channels on both ends, locking the hub and shell together. Each clip has pins that hold the nylon roller spacers in place, ensuring they stay aligned and secure during operation.
- **Pins:** Integrated into the clips, these pass through the nylon spacers (rollers) and keep them positioned between the hub and shell.

This modular construction allows for easy assembly, secure retention of rollers, and straightforward maintenance or part replacement.

## Required Parts

- 3D printed parts (see provided model files)
- 7mm x 10mm nylon spacers (used as rollers, quantity depends on design variant) - [amazon link](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B092DH57NP)

## Assembly Instructions

1. Print the parts using PETG, PCTG, or other durable filament.
2. Join the hub and outer shell from one end with a clip
3. Insert the 7mm x 10mm nylon spacers on the pins of joining clip.
4. Join the hub and outer shell from other end wit a second clip and make sure the pins align with rollers (apply force :p ).
5. Slide the assembled bearing onto the 2020 extrusion profile.

## Tips

- For best results, use high-quality nylon spacers and ensure your printer is well-calibrated for dimensional accuracy.
- Lubrication is generally not required due to the low-friction nature of nylon, but can be added for even smoother operation.

## Variants

- **Standard Bearing:** 48mm outer diameter, fits snugly around 2020 extrusion for general linear or rotational movement.
- **Rimmed Variant:** 52mm outer diameter with an additional rim, designed to allow four bearings to support and guide items such as filament rolls or spools. The rim keeps the supported object centered and stable on the rollers.

## Post-Processing

If your printer is well-calibrated and you use random seam placement, seams on the printed bearings will be nearly invisible both visually and by touch. However, if seam artifacts are present or your print settings are less optimized, light sanding of the bearing surface is strongly recommended to ensure smooth rolling and prevent wear on the supported object. Sanding with 180 grit sandpaper has been found effective for this purpose.
