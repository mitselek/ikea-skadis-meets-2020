# SK√ÖDIS Hooks Outreach Templates

This document contains various message templates for promoting the SK√ÖDIS hooks project on MakerWorld and other 3D printing communities.

## Template 1: Professional & Technical Focus

**Subject:** Advanced SK√ÖDIS Hook Design - Two-Slot Mounting System

```text
Hi [Name],

I came across your feedback on [Project Name] and noticed you're interested in SK√ÖDIS accessories. As a fellow maker working with SK√ÖDIS systems, I thought you might find my latest hook design interesting.

I've developed a set of 4 specialized SK√ÖDIS hooks that address some common limitations of standard single-slot hooks:

üîß **Two-slot mounting system** (40mm spacing) for superior stability
üîß **Four variants**: U, U-o, H, H-o hooks for different applications  
üîß **Center holes** in o-variants for threading cables, zip-ties, or countersunk screws
üîß **H-hooks create closed loops** when paired with hooks below

The project includes complete technical documentation, assembly photos, and even material supplier recommendations for PCTG printing.

## Template 2: Problem-Solution Focus

**Subject:** Solving SK√ÖDIS Hook Stability Issues

```text
Hi [Name],

Saw your comment on [Project Name] - great to meet another SK√ÖDIS enthusiast!

I've been frustrated with how single-slot hooks can wiggle and rotate under load, so I designed a two-slot mounting system that completely eliminates this problem. The hooks use standard 40mm SK√ÖDIS spacing for rock-solid mounting.

Key improvements:
‚Ä¢ **No more wobbly hooks** - two mounting points distribute load
‚Ä¢ **Secure precision tools** - perfect for calipers, measuring tools
‚Ä¢ **Cable management** - center holes for zip-ties and wire routing
‚Ä¢ **Closed loop option** - H-hooks prevent items from sliding off

Full documentation with assembly photos: https://makerworld.com/en/models/1503225-simple-skadis-hook#profileId-1572818

Curious to hear if you've had similar stability issues with standard hooks?

Cheers,
Mihkel

## Template 3: Community & Collaboration Focus

**Subject:** Open Source SK√ÖDIS Hook Improvements

```text
Hello [Name],

I noticed your involvement with [Project Name] and thought you might appreciate this open-source SK√ÖDIS project I've been working on.

I've designed an enhanced hook system that solves the stability issues of single-slot hooks through a two-slot mounting approach. The project includes:

üìÅ Complete technical documentation
üìÅ Assembly instructions with photos  
üìÅ 4 hook variants (U, U-o, H, H-o)
üìÅ STEP files for easy modification
üìÅ Material recommendations and supplier links

Since you're active in the SK√ÖDIS community, I'd really value your feedback on the design. Always looking to improve based on real-world usage!

## Template 4: Brief & Direct

**Subject:** Enhanced SK√ÖDIS Hooks with Two-Slot Mounting

```text
Hi [Name],

Quick question - have you ever had issues with SK√ÖDIS hooks rotating or feeling unstable under load?

I designed a two-slot mounting system that completely solves this. Four hook variants, detailed docs, and it's all open source.

Worth a look: https://makerworld.com/en/models/1503225-simple-skadis-hook#profileId-1572818

Let me know what you think!

## Template 5: Visual/Image Focus

**Subject:** Check out these SK√ÖDIS hook improvements (with photos)

```text
Hi [Name],

Noticed your interest in [Project Name] and thought you'd appreciate seeing these SK√ÖDIS hook improvements I've been working on.

The key innovation is a two-slot mounting system that eliminates the wobble and rotation issues of standard hooks. I've documented everything with assembly photos showing:

üì∏ Hook variants comparison
üì∏ Precision tool mounting (caliper example)
üì∏ Cable management applications
üì∏ Installation process

The documentation includes material recommendations and even supplier links for PCTG printing.

## Follow-up Templates

### Positive Response Follow-up

```text
Thanks for checking it out! 

A few questions if you don't mind:
- Which variant do you think would be most useful for your setup?
- Have you tried the precision tool mounting approach (like the caliper example)?
- Any suggestions for improvements or additional variants?

Always looking to refine the design based on user feedback.
```

### Technical Questions Response

```text
Great questions! Here are the key technical details:

- Print orientation: Flat on side for optimal layer strength
- No supports needed
- 15% infill recommended  
- PCTG preferred for strength, but PLA works fine for light-duty
- The 5mm center holes are sized for standard countersunk screws

The documentation has detailed specs and material supplier recommendations if you want to dive deeper.
```

### Interest but No Response Follow-up

```text
Hi [Name],

Just wanted to follow up on the SK√ÖDIS hooks I shared. Did you get a chance to look at the design?

I'm particularly curious about your thoughts on the two-slot mounting approach vs. traditional single-slot hooks. Have you experienced stability issues with standard hooks in your workshop?

No worries if you're busy - just genuinely interested in feedback from experienced SK√ÖDIS users like yourself.

Best,
Mihkel
