## Hook Variants

### Available Models

- **U Hook** (`hooks - U.step`) - Basic U-shaped hook
- **U-o Hook** (`hooks - U-o.step`) - U-shaped hook with 5mm center hole
- **H Hook** (`hooks - H.step`) - H-shaped hook for versatile mounting
- **H-o Hook** (`hooks - H-o.step`) - H-shaped hook with 5mm center hole

## Technical Specifications

### Mounting System

- **Type**: Two-slot SKÅDIS mounting
- **Slot spacing**: 40mm (standard SKÅDIS spacing)
- **Compatibility**: All IKEA SKÅDIS pegboards and panels

### Dimensions and Features

- **Material thickness**: Optimized for 3D printing
- **Center hole**: 5mm diameter (o-variants only, designed for countersunk screw heads)
- **Hole position**: Exact geometric center of hook
- **Hook depth**: 20mm from board plane

### Hook Geometry

- **U-shaped hooks**: Open on one side for easy item placement
- **H-shaped hooks**: Closed loop design when paired with any hook below
- **Center holes**: Designed for countersunk screws and lightweight materials (cable management)

## Functional Features

### U and U-o Hooks

- Open-sided design for quick item placement and removal
- Ideal for frequently accessed items
- Single-point hanging solution

### H and H-o Hooks

- Can form closed hanging loops when mounted above any other hook
- Prevents items from sliding off accidentally

### Center Hole Applications (o-variants)

- Mounting with countersunk screws for secure attachment
- Threading zip-ties for cable management and bundling
- Threading strings, wires, or lightweight cords
- Cable organization and routing
- Hanging items with string or thin cord attachments
- Creating custom hanging solutions

## Usage Instructions

### Installation

1. Verify SKÅDIS holes are clean and undamaged
2. Ensure 40mm spacing is available for two-slot mounting
3. Align the two mounting slots with SKÅDIS holes (40mm spacing)
4. Insert the upper mounting tab into the upper slot
5. Slide the hook down 5mm until the lower tab locks in place
6. Test stability before hanging items

### Creating Closed Loops with H Hooks

1. Mount any hook variant in the lower position first
2. Mount an H or H-o hook directly above (40mm spacing)
3. The H hook will form a closed loop with the lower hook
4. This configuration prevents items from sliding off

### Using Center Holes (o-variants)

1. For countersunk screws: Insert screw through hole and secure to mounting surface
2. For zip-ties: Thread zip-tie through hole for cable management or securing items
3. For threading: Pass string, wire, or cord through the 5mm center hole
4. Tie or secure the material as needed
5. Use for cable management or hanging lightweight items
6. Hole is positioned at exact center for balanced hanging

## Design Features

### Two-Slot Mounting

- Provides superior stability compared to single-slot hooks
- Distributes load across two mounting points
- Reduces stress on individual SKÅDIS holes
- Prevents hook rotation under load

### Modular Compatibility

- All variants use identical mounting system
- Can be mixed and matched as needed
- H hooks work with any hook below for closed loops
- Standardized 40mm spacing throughout

### Material Optimization

- Designed for standard 3D printing materials
- Optimized wall thickness for strength
- No support structures required for printing
- Efficient material usage

## Printing Guidelines

### Recommended Materials

- **PLA**: Standard printing, good for light-duty applications
- **PETG**: Enhanced durability and chemical resistance
- **PCTG**: Professional-grade strength and clarity

### Print Settings

- **Layer height**: 0.2-0.3mm for optimal strength
- **Infill**: 15% standard infill
- **Support**: No supports required
- **Orientation**: Print flat on side for best strength

### Post-Processing

- No post-processing required
- Test fit on SKÅDIS before final use

## Material Suppliers

### PCTG (Recommended for high-strength applications)

#### European Suppliers

- **Extrudr**: Professional-grade PCTG filaments
- **Fiberlogy**: High-quality PCTG with excellent clarity

#### US Suppliers

- **Fusion Filaments**: Premium PCTG materials
- **Printed Solid**: Professional printing materials
- **MatterHackers**: Wide selection of engineering plastics
- **3D Fuel**: [Pro PCTG](https://www.3dfuel.com/collections/petg-3d-printer-filament/products/pro-pctg-3d-printer-filament) - Professional-grade filament

## Application Samples

### Basic U Hook Usage
